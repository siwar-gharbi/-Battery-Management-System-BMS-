# -Battery-Management-System-BMS-
In this project, I designed a Battery Management System (BMS) Module tailored for 4 Cell / 4S 14.8V 40A Lithium-ion Batteries utilizing Altium Designer 24. This comprehensive system features integrated cell balancing, alongside robust protections against overvoltage, overcurrent, and short-circuit.

Throughout this project, I gained proficiency in:
- Drawing schematics.
- Creating components, drafting schematic symbols, and designing footprints.
- Placing components onto the PCB.
- Routing the PCB.
- Generating a 3D model to visualize the board's physical structure.
- Crafting a comprehensive Bill of Materials (BOM) for component procurement.
- Generating assembly drawings detailing component placement on the board.
- Generating manufacturing files such as Gerber, Pick and Place, and Drill files.
- Preparing professional documentation required for PCB manufacturing and board assembly.
